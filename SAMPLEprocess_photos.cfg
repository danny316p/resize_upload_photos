# In each folder you want to prepare photos, copy this file as
# process_photos.cfg
# Then set the variable values as you'd like in the editor of your choice.
# Then, from the command line, call process_photos.sh from within the 
# directory that contains this config file and your photos to be 
# processed. That way, you don't need to copy process_photos.sh to each
# directory, but process_photos.sh should know where to find everything.
